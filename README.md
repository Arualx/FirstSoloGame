# FirstSoloGame
My first game coding and doing the art solo.
#
# About
This is a 2D game about **a little penguin** jumping obstacles in the South Pole on Christmas day.

Both the art and coding are entirely created and combined by me, **Laura Veseljak**.

I created this game in **Unity**, programmed it using Unity's **C#**, designed the art in **Krita** and used music from free online resources.

#
# Experience
I learnt about:
- player movement
- collisions
- spawning and destroying obstacles
- track and display points
- parallax effect
- sprite animation
- background music
